	abstract = {Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such “big-data”. Researchers often use simulated data to assess and document the properties of these new methods, and in this paper we present an extension to the R-package simrel, which is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear model data with an extensive range of adjustable properties. The method is based on the concept of relevant components, and is equivalent to the newly developed envelope model. It is a multi-response extension of R-package simrel which is available in R-package repository {CRAN}, and as simrel the new approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix X, but in addition we introduce random rotations of latent components spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate response matrix Y. The properties of the linear relation between X and Y are defined by a small set of input parameters which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing variable selection methods in multi-response settings. The method is implemented as an update to the R-package simrel.},

	abstract = {Partial least squares ({PLS}) regression has been a very popular method for prediction. The method can in a natural way be connected to a statistical model, which now has been extended and further developed in terms of an envelope model. Concentrating on the univariate case, several estimators of the regression vector in this model are defined, including the ordinary {PLS} estimator, the maximum likelihood envelope estimator, and a recently proposed Bayes {PLS} estimator. These are compared with respect to prediction error by systematic simulations. The simulations indicate that Bayes {PLS} performs well compared with the other methods.},

	abstract = {Prediction performance does not always reflect the estimation behaviour of a method. High error in estimation may necessarily not result in high prediction error, but can lead to an unreliable prediction if test data lie in a slightly different subspace than the training data. In addition, high estimation error often leads to unstable estimates, and consequently, the estimated effect of predictors on the response can not have a valid interpretation. Many research fields show more interest in the effect of predictor variables than actual prediction performance. This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and well-established ({PCR}, {PLS}) estimation methods using simulated data with specifically designed properties such as Multicollinearity in the predictor variables, the correlation between multiple responses and the position of principal components corresponding to predictors that are relevant for the response. This study aims to give some insights into these methods and help the researchers to understand and use them for further study. Here we have, not surprisingly, found that no single method is superior to others, but each has its strength for some specific nature of data. In addition, the newly developed envelope method has shown impressive results in finding relevant information from data using significantly fewer components than the other methods.},

	abstract = {A linear regression model defines a linear relationship between two or 
more random variables. The random variables that depend on other random 
variables are often called response variables and the independent random 
variables are called predictor variables. In most cases not all variation is 
relevant for regression, i.e. only a certain amount of the variation in the 
predictors is relevant and only so for a part of the variation in the response. 
This leads to a reduction of the linear regression model where one can 
imagine a subspace of the space spanned by the predictor variables that 
contains all the relevant information for a subspace of the space spanned 
by the response variables. 
 
In this thesis, we attempt to compare some new methods which are based 
on the envelope model and some established methods such as principal 
components regression ({PCR}) and partial least squares regression ({PLS}). 
The comparison tests these methods on their performance of producing 
minimum prediction and estimation error while modelling data simulated 
with specifically designed properties. For the simulation, we have also 
created an R-package called simrel with a web interface. 
A simulation model for a multi-response multivariate linear model, on 
which the simulation tool is based, is discussed in the first paper. This 
paper prepares a basic foundation for the simulations with the concept of 
reduction of regression models. The second paper discusses the similarities 
of the envelope, {PCR} and {PLS} population models. This paper compares 
the prediction performance of several multivariate methods using a model 
with a single response. 
 
The final two papers make an extensive investigation evaluating the pre- 
diction and estimation performance of established ({PCR}, {PLS}1 and {PLS}2) 
and newly developed envelope based (Xenv and Senv) methods. Unsurprisingly 
the study found that not one method dominates in all situations, but 
their performance depends on the properties of the data they model. How- 
ever, the envelope based methods have shown remarkable performance in 
many cases, both in prediction and estimation. The study also recommends 
researchers to use and evaluate the envelope methods.},

	title = {Evaluation of Models for predicting the average monthly Euro versus Norwegian krone exchange rate from financial and commodity information},
	abstract = {Many multinational companies and policy makers carry out decisions by speculating
exchange rate. Exchange rate is determined by the demand and supply of a
currency. It depends highly on variables like imports, exports, interest rates, oil
prices, inflation and even with its past values. Since these macroeconomic variables
are highly correlated with each other, latent variables or principal components can
solve the problem of multicollinearity. The application of latent variables and principal
components based methods such as Principal Component Regression ({PCR})
and Partial Least Square ({PLS}) in time series data for prediction is uncommon.
Prediction of exchange rate of Norwegian Krone per Euro using Multiple linear regression,
Principal Component Regression ({PCR}) and Partial Least Square ({PLS})
regression is performed in this dissertation.
Linear models and its subsets obtained using criteria such as minimum {AIC} or
{BIC} and maximum R2adj are compared on the basis of their goodness of fit. The
selected model is then compared with models from principal component regression
and partial least square regression on the basis of predictability criteria of {RMSEP}
and R2 predicted. The results have suggested the partial least square regression as
the best models among other. The residuals obtained from the models have no autocorrelations
so the application of this method has not only reduced the dimension
of data but also resolved the problem of multicollinearity and autocorrelations.},

However, increased melanoma awareness in people with lighter pigmentation and many nevi may result in earlier diagnosis of thinner less-lethal tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between nevus count (asymmetrical \&gt; 5 mm and small symmetrical), pigmentary characteristics (hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, freckling, pigmentary score), and melanoma-specific mortality in subjects with melanomas \&gt; 1 mm. Data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort, established in 1991, with complete follow-up of melanoma patients until 2018 through the Cancer Registry of Norway, were used to estimate hazard ratios with 95\% confidence intervals for the associations between nevus count, pigmentary characteristics, and melanoma-specific mortality, stratified by tumor thickness using Cox regression. Estimated hazard ratios consistently indicated a higher risk of melanoma death for those with darker vs lighter pigmentary characteristics in patients with tumors \&gt; 1.0–2.0 mm and \&gt; 2.0 mm thick (e.g. pigmentary score hazard ratio 1.25, 95\% confidence interval (0.74–2.13)). Among women with melanomas \&gt; 1.0 mm thick, lighter pigmentation and asymmetrical nevi may be associated with lower melanoma-specific mortality, suggesting that factors that increase the risk of melanoma may also be associated with decreased risk of death from melanoma.},
