Whatever be the reason, data are really important things. R and different packages of R contains different datasets which we can use directly just by installing them. Many books related to R illustrate there examples using these data sources. We can find the dataset from differnt sources as `data()`\n\nThe datasets from the package `datasets` and other loaded packages is shown in default. However, we can obtain the datasets contained in specific packages as,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(package='MASS')\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe above will output the dataset contained in the package `MASS`. These datasets can be saved in a variable and used as different data structure like matrix, data frame or may be list. For example,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(Rubber, package='MASS') \nrubber.data <- Rubber\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Exercises\n  1. Save the Rabbit dataset from the package `MASS` into rabbitData and find the mean of BPchange for different Doses applied.\n  2. Load the data Greene from package `car` and find which location has the maximum variation in success.\n",
