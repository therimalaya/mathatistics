In order to understand how ANOVA finds the differences between \ngroups and how the group mean and their standard deviation influence the\nresults from ANOVA, let us consider following four cases:\n\nCase 1\n: Similar group means with high variation within the groups\n\nCase 2\n: Similar group means with low variation within the groups\n\nCase 3\n: Distant group means with high variation within the groups\n\nCase 4\n: Distant group means with low variation within the groups\n\n## Simulating data resembling these cases\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Fitting ANOVA model for each cases\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Prepare data for plotting\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nâ„¹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.21\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 1.48\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 6.18\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.66\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.21\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 1.48\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 6.18\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.66\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 3.12\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 3.47\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 6.01\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nPicking joint bandwidth of 6.22\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.svg){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n\n\n",
