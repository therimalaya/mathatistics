Biplot in case of principal component analysis (PCA) plot both variable and observation in latent scale (scores and loadings). Throughout this article, I will use [`USArrests`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.3.2/topics/USArrests) data from `datasets` package. Lets fit a PCA model using `princomp` function. However, this can also be done using `prcomp`. The later one uses singular value decomposition while the former one uses eigenvalue decomposition. Here I have used correlation rather than covariance to compute principal components because there are large values in case of `Murder` and `UrbanPop`\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npc.a <- princomp(USArrests, cor = TRUE)\nplot(pc.a, type = \"lines\", pch = 22, bg = \"grey\",\n     main = \"Variance explained by each componets in PCA\")\ntext(1:4, pc.a$sdev^2, pos = 4,\n     labels = round(cumsum(pls::explvar(pc.a)), 1))\nbox()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Variance of each components and the proportaion of the total variance explained for each additional components is displayed as label](index_files/figure-html/get-records-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, with three components, we have captured 95.7 percent of total variation present in `USArrests` dataset. Lets get the biplot and try to understand it.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nautoplot(\n  pc.a, label = T, shape = FALSE,\n  loadings = TRUE, loadings.label = TRUE,\n  label.size = 3.5, label.repel = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/biplot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n",
