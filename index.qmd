Hi,
:::

::: lead
I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Oslo working on analyzing melanoma incidence and survival trend in Norway. My research interest lies in the intersection of statistics, data visualization, web and programming.

I live in Drammen, a beautiful city in Norway, with my wife and a son. I spend my personal time mostly cycling, hiking and taking pictures. I also like listining music and sometimes binge watching movies & serial.
